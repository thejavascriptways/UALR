Students with Disabilities
If you are a student with a disability, or if you simply want to discuss resources that might help you learn more effectively, you can contact the Disability Resource Center at any time. You are welcome to drop in or call 501-916-3143 to make an appointment. Their staff will work with you to discuss accommodations and identify resources on campus or in the community that might be helpful for you. Accommodations are established through an interactive process. For more information, visit the DRC website or review the steps to request accommodations. We want you to know you are valued, welcome, and wanted at UA Little Rock.
